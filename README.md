This is a passion project. I am learning technology by implementing it. Anyone is invited to contribute with the mindset of learning by doing.


Any contribution is appreciated. Currently working on frontend.

### Local Setup (Windows)
This is a monorepo, currently, I am working on the Frontend. So the below instructions are for the same.
```
1. Clone the repo
2. cd MindChart
3. yarn
4. cd packages/client
5. yarn start
```
(Create an issue if these are not working for you)

### Tech Stack
#### Frontend
1. React
2. TypeScript
3. EmotionJs
4. D3js
#### Backend
TBD (maybe GraphQl, Relay, PostgreSQL, ExpressJs)
