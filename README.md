#### `Trying to build something that could be used to visualize our thoughts more effectively.`

I am using [D3js](https://d3js.org/) for that.

Any contribution is appreciated.

### Local Setup (Windows)
This is a monorepo, currently, I am working on the Frontend. So the below instructions are for the same.
```
1. Clone the repo
2. cd MindChart
3. yarn
4. cd packages/client
5. yarn start
```
(Create an issue if these are not working for you)
